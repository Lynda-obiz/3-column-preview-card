## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
<!-- - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

While working on this project i learnt more on using flexbox, psuedo selectors and media query.
Below are code samples of my project:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="suv">
    <img src="./images/icon-suvs.svg" alt="SUVS Icon">
    <h1>SUVS</h1>
    <p>Take an SUV for its spacious interior, power, and versatility. Perfect for your next family vacation and off-road adventures.</p>
    <a class="link" href="#">Learn More</a>
</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .link:hover{
    background: transparent;
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
}
}
```

### Continued development

I will be focusing more on learning media quueries and css grid next to perfect my techniques.  

### Useful resources
